Virtual DOM - Working behind the scenes. 

Ninjas component is updating constantly receiving different versions of props when ninjas are removed or added to the state of the root component. Every time we get those new props we want to update JSX template depending on the data so we can output it to browser. Every time we get an update we take the update to JSX template and react makes a Virtual DOM out of it which is the Java script representation of the template. At all times it has a current Virtual DOM running in the background and that represents the actual DOM sitting in the browser. when we create a new Virtuam DOM based on all changes in the data is then compared to Virtaul DOM current, only those changes in the template is updated in the browser. Only the differences has to be updated and rerendered to the application. This cycle happens everytime when there is a change in the data.
